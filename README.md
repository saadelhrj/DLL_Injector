<h1> DLL Injection Code </h1>
<p> DLL Injector for windows processes written in C </p>


<h2> Discription </h2>
<p> The purpose of this code is to inject a malicious DLL into a thread of a Target Process, This will allow any code inside the DLL to be run as a part of the Target Process,
Which means hiding from plain site ( TaskManager, Process monitor, Process Explorer,etc), Its also undetectable by some EDR solutions( Sophos and Avast One had no reaction). 

The main functions in the code are the VirtualAllocEx, WriteProcessMemory &amp; CreateRemoteThread Functions,
The code can be tweaked to fit your goals. </p>
for Example : you can use it to get a reverse shell by specifiying a shellcode generated by Metasploit instead of a dll path. 

<h2> Usage </h2>
<ul> 
<li>Create a DLL project in Visual studio same the one in the 3rd picture below.</li> 
<li> Fill it with whatever code you want to be Injected and then build the solution.</li>
<li> Paste the path to the compiled .dll file inside the dllpath variable in the Injection Code </li>
<li> Make sure the Target Process is running, You can specify the explorer.exe to avoid any probleme </li>
<li> Compile and Run the Injector code and obesrve in Process monitor that your dll file is injected </li>

<p> PS: Make the gcc compiles an exe with the same architecture as the target process, a x32 exe cannot open a x64 process.</p>
